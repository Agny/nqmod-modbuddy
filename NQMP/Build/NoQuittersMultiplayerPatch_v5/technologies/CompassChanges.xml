	<!-- At Compass tech, add 1 extra embark move, and embarkation from sea to land or vice versa is only 1 point. -->
	<!-- NOTE: Unlike Denmark ability, going from sea to land will result in loss of movement points you otherwise wouldn't have had if your turn started on land to begin with. -->
	<!-- Example: Start turn with Spearmen in coast with 4 embarked movement, it moves to land, has 3 movement left (-1). It gets 1 move left (2 base land movement - 1 used). -->
